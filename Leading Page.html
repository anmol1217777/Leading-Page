         organic food, fresh or processed food produced by organic farming methods.<br>
       Organic food is grown without the use of synthetic chemicals, such as <br>
       human-made pesticides and fertilizers, and does not contain genetically <br>
       modified organisms (GMOs). Organic foods include fresh produce, meats, <br>
       and dairy products as well as processed foods such as crackers, drinks, <br>
       and frozen meals. The market for organic food has grown significantly <br>
       since the late 20th century, becoming a multibillion dollar industry <br>
       with distinct production, processing, distribution, and retail systems.
